I have implemented a run Tests method, in which I have combined all 'logical' combinations of sets, so I don't need to test randomly each time.
for this file this is the typical output you may have:

As we can see, for 11 slots, we have 0 clashes at step 2, and for slots 10 min clashes at step 27, hence I don't need to implemente
a training algorithm for this as we already have the minimum just using this.(however the tests are still appliable vor this one too)

The best result was 
INFO: Test with slots = 28, shifts = 26, iterations = 1,000 resulted in min clashes = 222 at step 375

Then I proceeded with trying to minimize the number of clashes. 
this is how i implemented it 
1. Keep track of the combinations of course slots and shifts that have been used.
2. Train the network on the existing clash data.
3. Predict and set better slots for the courses to minimize clashes.
4. Continues training on the expanded data, optimizing the timetable further with each click.
For training I used  the Hopfield Network to set it in the corresponding timeslot. 
And the best output would have been to iterate again over the courses on each Continue button click to further reduce clashes by shifting them within the period defined.

So after running the start over the best combination found, I got

Then I decided to ask how my friends did their tasks, ( here I used the algorithm Taron Schisas suggested, but modified it to meet my standarts, as my files were too big)
I will upload the zipped folder, where i do the algorithm(as the files were too big to read, i implemented the json reader for them, but i 
will state the logic here)

I used the best results here, trained them. as the number of clashes were big, i used fullChainUpdate, but still got almost same results

And these are the results I got after :
Shift = 26      Min clashes = 322       at step 382

So the best results after 3 different algorithms was the first one
INFO: Test with slots = 28, shifts = 26, iterations = 1,000 resulted in min clashes = 222 at step 375 + training and 218 clashes.
